# django-billingmanager

Project that helps me manage my recurrent and one-time bills.

It's currently designed to run without webservers due to budget constraints. Its initial purpose is to be ran locally using runserver and a simple sqlite database shared via dropbox so there'll be a several scripts that'll be ran on runtime.

Spec might change in the future if I decide to buy a VPS or a good home server (my current home server is a refurbished old and noisy Pentium 4 PC with motherboard issues)
